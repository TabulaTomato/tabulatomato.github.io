      <h3>the gameplay</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
      <p>The game is cooperative, so you should make all the decisions together. <br>During the game, whenever you discover a new location, you should put the location card on the table, under the location cards that you've already opened. You can then take the character/object/plant/animal cards from the deck according to the card numbers written on the location card, and put them in their provided slots on the location card. The game will also sometimes tell you to take a card from the deck. When this happens, put the card in a free slot on a location card or somewhere next to it. You can use these cards as any other card.<br>You can do different types of actions during the game, which will be explained later. To do these actions, you will use the <b>Digital Game Book</b> as described in <b>Actions and Digital Game Book</b> section.<br>The game will automatically finish when you've discovered what you were supposed to.<br>There is no time limit for playing the game, and there are no negative points for asking questions or making wrong combinations of objects in the game. So, feel free to do whatever comes to your mind.<br>If you get stuck, use the hint system. But remember to examine all the cards that you're supposed to, speak to all of the characters you meet in the game and open every new location you were suggested to.<br>Start the game by exploring the cards you were given in the beginning.</p>

      <h3>types of cards</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
      <p>There are three types of cards:</p>
  		<h4><b>1.</b> LOCATIONS, marked with capital letters LOC followed by a number</h4>
  		<h4><b>2.</b> CHARACTERS, marked with numbers. If the card is marked with <img class="small" src="images/usta.png">, you can immediately speak to this character. If not, the character is not there, or can't communicate for another reason. You can only talk about this character, but you cannot talk to them.</h4>
  		<h4><b>3.</b> OBJECTS / PLANTS / ANIMALS, marked with numbers. If the card is marked with <img class="small" src="images/ruka.png">, this object / plant / animal can be used immediately. Cards without this symbol canâ€™t be used but only talked about.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="main-box">
      <h3>actions and digital game book</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
      <p>Each chapter has its Digital Game Book, which is actually an input field that serves as your tool to do the actions in the game. It will look like this:</p>
      <div class="second-input">
        <button class="input-type">input here</button>
        <button class="input-ok-button">OK</button>
      </div>
      <p><b>Actions</b> you can take during the game are:</p>

      <h6><b>To examine a location, character or an object / plant / animal, enter their card number in the input field of the Digital Game Book and click 'OK' or press Enter.</b></h6>

You can also see Ziggy's opinion on things this way, by entering Ziggy's card number followed by the card number of want to see her opinion about in the input field.</b></h6>

      <h4><b>3.</b> GIVE AN OBJECT to a character</h4>
      <h6><b>To give an object to a character, enter the character's card number followed by the object's card number in the input field of the Digital Game Book, separated by a comma, without spaces, and click 'OK' or press Enter. This is done the same way as the previous action.</b></h6>
      <p>For example, if you want to give <b>Frank (25)</b> a <b>book (43)</b>, enter '25,43' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter.</p>
      <h4><b>4.</b> USE AN OBJECT / PLANT / ANIMAL on another object / plant / animal</h4>
      <h6><b>To use an object on another object, type their cards numbers in the input field separated by a comma, without spaces and click 'OK' or press Enter. The order of the card numbers isn't relevant.</b></h6>
      <p>For example, if you want to open the <b>door (36)</b> with a <b>key (29)</b>, enter '36,29' or '29,36' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter.</p>
  		<h4><b>5.</b> OPEN A NEW LOCATION</h4>
      <h6><b>To open a new location, type the according address in the input field. You can find the address of every location by looking at the map, marked with a capital letter and a following number. Sometimes the address of the new location will be a solution to a puzzle and sometimes the game will give you a hint that there is a location that you should go to. Don't forget to open new locations that you were suggested to visit.</b></h6>
      <p>For example, if you want to go to the <b>Bus Station</b>, find its address on the map. There is A32 written on the Bus Station on the map, so you should enter 'A32' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter.</p>
  		<h4><b>6.</b> Enter A CODE in an object when instructed</h4>
      <h6><b>The game will tell you which objects need to be opened by a code when you examine them. To enter a code, type the object's card number followed by the code in the input field separated by a comma, without spaces.</b></h6>
      <p>For example, if you want to open a <b>safe 10</b> with a <b>999 code</b>, enter '10,999' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter.</p>
