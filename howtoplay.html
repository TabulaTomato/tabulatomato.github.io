      <h3>the gameplay</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
      <p>The game is cooperative, so you should make all the decisions together. <br>During the game, whenever you discover a new location, you should put the location card in one of the free slots on the board. You can then take the character/object/plant/animal cards which numbers are written on the location card from the deck and put them in the provided slots on the location card. The game will also sometimes tell you to take a card from the deck. When this happens, put the card in one of the free provided slots on the board. <br>There are three types of cards:</p>
      <ul class="list">
  			<li>&#10148; LOCATIONS, marked with capital letters LOC followed by a number</li>
  			<li>&#10148; CHARACTERS, marked with numbers. If the card is marked with <img class="small" src="images/usta.png">, you can immidiately speak to this character. If not, the character is not there, or can't communicate for another reason. You can only talk about this character, but you cannot talk to them.</li>
  			<li>&#10148; OBJECTS / PLANTS / ANIMALS, marked with numbers. If the card is marked with <img class="small" src="images/ruka.png">, this object / plant / animal can be used immidiately and you can put them in your inventory as soon as you get them. Cards without this symbol can only be talked about and they are to be left on the location they were found at.</li>
  		</ul>
      <p><b>Actions</b> you can take during the game are:</p>
      <ul class="list">
  			<li>&#10148; EXAMINE locations, characters and objects. You can examine any card you want, but you have to examine the cards marked with <img class="small" src="images/leca.png"></li>
  			<li>&#10148; See YOUR OWN OPINION on a character, an object and a location</li>
  			<li>&#10148; QUESTION CHARACTERS about other characters, objects and locations</li>
        <li>&#10148; GIVE AN OBJECT to a character</li>
        <li>&#10148; USE AN OBJECT on another object</li>
  			<li>&#10148; OPEN A NEW LOCATION</li>
  			<li>&#10148; ENTER A CODE in an object when instructed</li>
  		</ul>
      <p>To do these actions, you will use the Game Book as described bellow.<br>The game will automatically finish when you've discovered what you were supposed to.<br>There is no time limit for playing the game, and there are no negative points for asking questions or making wrong combinations of objects in the game. So feel free to do what ever comes to your mind.<br>If you get stuck, use the hint system. But remember to examine all the cards that you're supposed to, speak to all of the characters you meet in the game and open every new location you were suggested to.<br>Start the game by exploring the cards you were given in the beginning.</p>

      <h3>how to use the game book</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
      <p>Each chapter has its game book, which is actually an input field that serves as your tool to examine the cards, communicate with characters, use objects, search for new locations and enter codes.</p>
      <h4>To EXAMINE a location, character or an object, the corresponding number/letter in the input field. You can do this for any card you like, but you have to do it for the cards with the magnifying glass symbol.</h4>
      <p>For example, if you want to know more about <b>Ziggy 01</b>, enter '01' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter. If you want to explore location <b>Our house LOC01</b>, enter 'loc01' or 'LOC01' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter.</p>
      <h4>To QUESTION CHARACTERS about an another character or an object, or to GIVE AN OBJECT to a character, type their according numbers in the input field separated by a comma, without spaces. Type the number of the character you want to speak to FIRST, and the character / object / plant / animal you want to speak about SECOND. If you want to give an object to a character, type the character's number FIRST, and the object's SECOND. If you ask Ziggy about something, you will hear her thoughts about it.</h4>
      <p>For example, if you want to hear <b>Ziggy's 01</b> thoughts about her <b>mother 23</b>, enter '01,23' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter.</p>
      <h4>You can also ask a character about themselves by writing their corresponding number two times in the input field separated by a comma, without spaces.</h4>
      <p>For example, if you want to hear <b>Ziggy's 01</b> thoughts about herself, enter '01,01' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter.</p>
      <h4>To USE AN OBJECT on another object, type their corresponding numbers in the input field separated by a comma, without spaces. The order of the numbers isn't relevant.</h4>
      <p>For example, if you want to give <b>dog cookies mix 05</b> to <b>Laika 40</b>, enter '05,40' or '40,05' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter.</p>
      <h4>To OPEN A NEW LOCATION, type the according address in the input field. You can find the address of every location by looking at the map, marked with a capital letter and a following number.</h4>
      <p>For example, if you want to go to the Bus Station, enter 'A32' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter.</p>
      <h4>The game will tell you which objects need to be opened by a code when you examine them. To ENTER A CODE type the object's according nubmer followed by the code in the input field separated by a comma, without spaces.</h4>
      <p>For example, if you want to open a <b>safe 10</b> with a <b>999 code</b>, enter '10,999' in the input field and click 'OK' or press Enter.</p>
