    <div class="main-text">
      <p>It's always been just the two of us, my mother and me. She was a single mother, and I was created with a little help of a sperm bank. I can't complain about it, she was an amazing mother and I never felt that our family is missing a third person. My mother was a bit lonely at times, but she hid it well. We've been living in our bubble of happiness during my 20 years on this planet. But now the bubble has burst...<br>It's been five days since my mother died. I'm still trying to comprehend what happened. Everything was fine up until two months ago. I was at the university, living my student life of lectures, tests, making friendships and flirting with cute fellow students. Who could have known that a simple phone call would change me forever. <br><i>"Ziggy, I don't want you to worry, but you have to know what's happening. I'm sick."</i>, she said. She was optimistic and she started treatment immediately. She said that cancer cannot bring her down. Even the doctors said that everything will be ok. But her condition worsened despite their predictions. I left my student dorm and came back home to take care of her. It was horrible. Very soon she started to lose her memory and the times when her mind was clear became precious moments when we could share our thoughts. Finally, her body just couldn't fight the sickness anymore. <br>The last time she spoke she said something that I can't get my head around: <i>"Ziggy, you mustn't be alone. You have to find her...I was wrong not to tell you...I'm so sorry, Ziggy!"</i>. I don't know what was she talking about. Who is this woman I should find? What didn't she tell me? All I have left are all these questions and the family gem that she left me. <br>After the funeral, I went to sleep at a friend's house. I just couldn't bare to come home where everything reminds me of her. But I have to return today, I can't expect our neighbours to take care of our dog Laika forever.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="main-text">
      <p>In this game you take the character of Ziggy Wonder, whose mother Lena died five days ago and left her with a mysterious message. The goal of this chapter of the game is to discover the truth behind Lena's final words. <br>The game is cooperative, so you should make all the decisions together. <br>During the game, whenever you discover a new location, you should put the location card on one of the free places on the board. You can then take the character/object cards which numbers are written on the location card from the deck and put them on the provided spaces on the location card. The game will also sometimes tell you to take a card from the deck. In this case, put the card on one of the free provided spaces under the town map. <br>There are three types of cards:</p>
      <ul class="list">
  			<li>&#10148; Locations, marked with capital letters</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Characters, marked with numbers</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Objects, marked with numbers</li>
  		</ul>
      <p>Actions you can take during the game are:</p>
      <ul class="list">
  			<li>&#10148; Examine locations, characters and objects. You can examine any card you want, but you have to examine the cards with the magnifying glass symbol</li>
  			<li>&#10148; See your own opinion on a character or an object</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Question characters about other characters and objects</li>
        <li>&#10148; Give an object to a character</li>
        <li>&#10148; Use an object on another object</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Open a new location</li>
  		</ul>
      <p>To do these actions, you will use the interactive game book bellow as described.<br>The game will automatically finish when you've discovered what you were supposed to.</p>
