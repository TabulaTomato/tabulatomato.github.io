      <p>It's been five days since my mother died. I'm still trying to comprehend what happened. Everything was fine up until six months ago. I was at the university, living my student life of lectures, tests, making friendships and flirting with cute fellow students. Who could have known that a simple phone call would change me forever. <br>"Ziggy, I don't want you to worry, but you have to know what's happening. I'm sick.", she said. She was positive, started treatment immediately. Even the doctors said that everything will be ok. But her condition worsened despite their predictions. I came home from the university to spend those last few days with her. Finally, her body just couldn't fight the sickness anymore. <br>The last thing she told me was: "Ziggy, you mustn't be alone. I was wrong, you have to find them...". I don't know what was she talking about. Do we have family she never told me about? What about my father? Maybe her story of a sperm donor was just a cover up for the truth she didn't want me to know about? She left me with all this questions, together with pain of losing her. <br>After the funeral, I just couldn't bare to return into the house where everything reminds me of her. But I have to return today, I can't expect our neighbours to take care of our dog Laika forever.</p>

      <p>In this game you take the character of Ziggy Wonder, whose mother Lena died a few days ago and left her with mysterious last words. The goal of the game is to discover what did her mother mean, and what is Ziggy's true destiny. <br>The game is cooperative, so you should make all the decisions together. <br>During the game you will take cards from the deck when instructed. Also, whenever you get a new location, you can take all the cards with numbers written on the location. <br>There are three types of cards:</p>
      <ul class="list">
  			<li>&#10148; Locations, marked with capital letters</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Characters, marked with numbers</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Objects, marked with numbers</li>
  		</ul>
      <p>Actions you can take during the game are:</p>
      <ul class="list">
  			<li>&#10148; Examine locations, characters and objects. You can examine any card you want, but you have to examine the cards with the magnifying glass symbol</li>
  			<li>&#10148; See your own opinion on a character or an object</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Question characters about other characters and objects</li>
        <li>&#10148; Give an object to a character</li>
        <li>&#10148; Use an object on another object</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Search the internet to find informaton that will help you to proceed in the game. Either the game will tell you when to use the internet, or you will get a card with a wi-fi symbol. When one of these two situations happen, it means that some information used in a puzzle can be found on the internet.</li>
        <li>&#10148; Enter a four digit code to open an object or make progress in the game. The game will instruct you on which cards can be affected by a four digit code</li>
