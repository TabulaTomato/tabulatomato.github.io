    <div class="main-text">
      <p>It's always been just the two of us, a single mother and a child created with a little help of a sperm bank. I can't complain about it, I never felt that our family is missing a third person. I had a great childhood, living in our little bubble of happiness. However, I knew that she felt a bit trapped living a peaceful life of working, taking care of me, stargazing on a bright night and dreaming of adventures that seem to pass her by. Sometimes she said that she doesn't really belong here. But I never imagined that she could do something like this. <br>I'm still trying to comprehend what happened. Yesterday, when I came home from the university the house was empty. I thought that she must have gone for a drink after work or something. I started to make dinner when I heard my phone ringing. It was her. <br><i>"Ziggy, I don't want you to worry, or to be mad at me. I had to leave."</i>, she said. Before I managed to say something, she continued:<br><i>"This town is suffocating me. I know this can seem a bit out of the blue, but I feel this way for a very long time."</i><br>I went to her room and saw that her clothes are really gone.<br><i>"Mother, you're joking, right?"</i>, I asked in disbelief. <br><i>"You're all grown up now and you don't need me anymore. I need to have some time for me, to see what do I really want from life. It's a lot to ask, but please understand. Take good care of yourself. I love you."</i>I heard her voice breaking a bit, as if she was holding back tears. <br><i>"And don't forget to feed Laika!"</i>was the last thing she said before hanging up. I tried to call her again but her phone was turned off.<br> I couldn't sleep all night. My mother left me all alone. That's not like her at all. I can't believe that she would dissapear like that, with nothing but a little goodbye over the phone. And what was this about feeding our dog? That's the last thing she wanted to say to me? Really? I just don't get it.</p>

    <div class="main-text">
      <p>In this game you take the character of Ziggy Wonder, whose mother Lena mysteriously left town, leaving Ziggy with a strange explanation of her actions in a phone call. The goal of the game is to discover why did Lena leave so abruptly. <br>The game is cooperative, so you should make all the decisions together. <br>During the game, whenever you discover a new location, you should put the location card on one of the free places on the board. You can then take the character/object cards which numbers are written on the location card from the deck and put them on the provided spaces on the location card. The game will also sometimes tell you to take a card from the deck. In this case, put the card on one of the free provided spaces under the town map. <br>There are three types of cards:</p>
      <ul class="list">
  			<li>&#10148; Locations, marked with capital letters</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Characters, marked with numbers</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Objects, marked with numbers. Animals and plants also fall in this category and for the purposes of rules explanation they will be referred to as objects in further text.</li>
  		</ul>
      <p>Actions you can take during the game are:</p>
      <ul class="list">
  			<li>&#10148; Examine locations, characters and objects. You can examine any card you want, but you have to examine the cards with the magnifying glass symbol</li>
  			<li>&#10148; See your own opinion on a character or an object</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Question characters about other characters and objects</li>
        <li>&#10148; Give an object to a character</li>
        <li>&#10148; Use an object on another object</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Open a new location</li>
  			<li>&#10148; Enter a code in an object when instructed</li>
  		</ul>
      <p>To do these actions, you will use the interactive game book bellow as described.<br>The game will automatically finish when you've discovered what you were supposed to.</p>

      <p>Take cards <b>01</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>A</b> from the deck, without looking at the other cards. Put them on the provided spaces on the board, so that everybody can see them. <br>Put the rest of the location deck on the table, facing down. Put the rest of character and objects deck next to it, also facing down.<br>You will be using the interactive game book during the game, so keep the computer with this website open on the table in front of all the players, or have the website open on a phone. It is recommended to read aloud the text from the interactive game book if you are playing with more than one player. In this case, you can switch turns for reading as often as you wish.<br>You can keep a piece of paper and a pen on the side to note clues during the game, or you can always repeat any entry in the interactive game book to remember what did the book say.<br>There is no time limit for playing the game, and there are no negative points for asking questions or making wrong combinations of objects in the game. So feel free to do what ever comes to your mind.<br>If you get stuck, use the hint system. But remember to examine all the cards that have a magnifying glass symbol, speak to all of the characters you meet in the game and open every new location you were suggested to.<br>Start the game by exploring the cards you were given in the beginning.</p>
