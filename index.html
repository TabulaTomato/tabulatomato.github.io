      <p>It's been five days since my mother died. I'm still trying to comprehend what happened. Everything was fine up until six months ago. I was at the university, living my student life of lectures, tests, making friendships and flirting with cute fellow students. Who could have known that a simple phone call would change me forever. <br>"Ziggy, I don't want you to worry, but you have to know what's happening. I'm sick.", she said. She was positive, started treatment immediatelly. Even the doctors said that everything will be ok. But her condition worsened despite their predictions. I came home from the university to spend thess last few days with her. Finally, her body just couldn't fight the sickness anymore. <br>The last thing she told me was: "Ziggy, you mustn't be alone. I was wrong, you have to find them..." I don't know what was she talking about. Do we have family she never told me about? What about my father? Maybe her story of a sperm donor was just a cover up for the truth she didn't want me to know about? She left me with all this questions in my head, together with pain of losing her. <br>After the funeral, I just couldn't bare to return into the house where everything reminds me of her. But I have to return today, I can't expect our neighbours to take care of our dog Laika forever.</p>
